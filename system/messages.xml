	<message name="/save-shorthelp">Save your state.</message>
	<message name="/save-longhelp"><![CDATA[Usage: [bold]/save[/color]

	<message name="/room-longhelp"><![CDATA[Usage: [bold]/room <add|delete> <roomnum>[/color]
       [bold]/room name <newname>[/color]
       [bold]/room desc [+|-] [newdesc][/color]
       [bold]/room exit <direction> <targetroomnum>[/color]

Allows you to create, update, or delete rooms. Remember that new rooms will not have any exits. Also, exits are not bidirectional -- if you give room 1500 an exit W to room 1501, this does not create an exit E from 1501 back to 1500.

Room descriptions can be viewed in plain text (with formatting markers visible), appended to, removed from, cleared, or set:
 * [yellow]/room desc[/color] will give you the room description in plain text, i.e. without hiding the formatting markers.
 * [yellow]/room desc new description[/color] will set the current room description to "new description".
 * [yellow]/room desc + new line[/color] will add the line "new line" to the current room description.
 * [yellow]/room desc - deleted text[/color] will remove all instances of "deleted text" from the current room description.
 * [yellow]/room desc -[/color] will clear the room description altogether, leaving it empty.
